# Gesture Recognition System

A real-time gesture recognition system that detects hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning. The system can currently recognize three basic gestures: Hand Wave, Peace Sign, and Thumbs Up.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam
- Three supported gestures:
  - Hello/Wave (open hand)
  - Peace Sign (V sign)
  - Thumbs Up
- Visual feedback with hand landmarks and bounding boxes
- Built with MediaPipe and OpenCV
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (required for MediaPipe compatibility)
- Webcam
- Windows/Mac/Linux

## Interaction
Show your hand to the camera to detect gestures
Hold gestures steady for better recognition
Ensure good lighting and clear background
Press 'Q' to quit the application

## Supported Gestures
Hello/Wave: Open hand with fingers spread
Peace Sign: Index and middle fingers extended, others curled
Thumbs Up: Thumb extended upward, other fingers curled

## Future Goals
The long-term vision for this project is to develop a comprehensive Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition system that can:
1. Recognize complete ISL alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9)
2. Understand basic ISL phrases and sentences
3. Provide real-time translation from ISL to text/speech
4. Support multiple signers and different signing styles
5. Handle dynamic gestures and sentence formation
6. Become an accessible communication tool for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community
7. Support both one-handed and two-handed signs
8. Include facial expression recognition for complete context
